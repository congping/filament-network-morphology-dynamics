# filament-network-morphology-dynamics

 this program simulate a network morphological dynamics under time evolution. The network composed of filaments connecting between a set of fixed points. during the evolution, new points/edges may appear and split, edges may merge. edges under flow can bend.

ERdynamic_curvature_torus.m is the main code to run where parameters such as initial locations of anchors (or initial network) and model parameters are set there. Note that persistent points are always listed first in node location lists.

matlab code is developed by Congping Lin
